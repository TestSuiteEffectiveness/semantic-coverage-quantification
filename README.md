The site includes two directories:  scripts, where we include all the python scrips and Java classes we used in our experiment data, where we include all the original and derived data we obtained in our experiment
The scripts directory includes:
1. computeArcs: to find common Arcs and union of Arcs between every pairs of graphs.
2. GenerateRandomTestSuites: to generate random test suites between T1- T20
3. Semantic Coverage: to compute Partial and correctness semantic coverge in respect of R1,R2 and R3
4. Inclusion: to find the inclusion among the metrics
The data directory includes:
1. Results of the experiments
2. T0: output of T0
3. T1..T20
4. Specifications: R1, R2 and R3
5. Benchmark: include the source file: FastMath and test class FastMathTest
